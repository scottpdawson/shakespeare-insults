# Shakespeare Insults

Since 1996, the origin of this kit was listed as anonymous. It came to [Chris Seidel](http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/) on a piece of paper in the 90's with no attribution and they thought it would make a [cool web page](http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/shake_rule.html). In 2014, Lara M (?) found the originating author, an English teacher at Center Grove High School in Greenwood Indiana named Jerry Maguire. I took a master class on Shakespearean speech from the great [J. G. Hertzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Hertzler) in April 2015 and have been intrigued by the bard's insults ever since.
